                        SoloQ WR gives the best idea of what is a powerful champion, it certainly isn't the only factor
                        and ideally we want to consider certain contexts like, Elo, OTPs, Enemy Draft, ect. Right now as
                        of 19/12/2024 we're in patch 14.24, Warwick has gone through some <i>changes</i>.

                        Players are naturally drawn to professionals as a source of authority, if they think it's good
                        then it <i>must</i> be good. <strong>This is incredibly wrong</strong>, but it works to our
                        advantage since we have a good idea of what to expect to see in our games.

                    <Text>
                        Pro-players don't tend to dictate the META in-fact they follow the solutions provided by lower
                        ranks (Gold+). High-level play is about execution of what is effective, lower-level play
                        emphasises <i>creativity</i>. As a result professional META tends to lag behind the META curve,
                        and allows us to craft our own META around these choices.
